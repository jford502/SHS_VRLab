Stilwell HIgh School VR Development Lab

Greetings to all who care to venture into the fringe.

This will be a repository [initially] for all things related to content development projects created and explored in the Stilwell High School Technology Lab. 

Projects could include content from/for: computer science programming in C++, Java, &/or Python; Content creation software such as Blender for 3D modelling, UnReal Engine, Unity, NEOSVR, & EngageVR; 3D Scanning using the Einscan Pro handheld scanner, Intel RealSense depth scanners, & Insta360 3D cameras; Drone piloting, recording,  and scanning applications; IoT projects using arduino;  and possibly others as we learn more.

Just playing around with things at the moment... trying to figure out how to use this  (-J. Ford)
